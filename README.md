# Personal Portfolio

Hi, I hope you are doing well.

For whomever it is reading this, on this repository you will find my personal portfolio.
I have worked day and night on this project and I'm proud of sharing the results. 
It has my information, personal highlights, resume and some of my favorites programming projects.
I have loved every second of my path with programming and I hope to keep learning and getting in love
with it every day. 

You can see it online and hosted for free on the vercel platform https://diegoplata-portfolio.vercel.app/ or
You can also see it online and hosted for free on the netlify platform https://diegoplata-portfolio.netlify.app/

Thank you, 
Diego Plata.
